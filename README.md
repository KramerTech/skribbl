# Random custom word list generator for [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/)

Visit [https://kramertech.github.io/skribbl](https://kramertech.github.io/skribbl) to get a randomized list of properly formatted (comma-separated) words to mix it up on skribbl.io once you notice the default list is getting repetitive.

There are over 6000 words in the dictionary, and 300 (by default) will be selected at random each time the page loads. Adjust the `?len=` query param in the URL for more or less random words. The dictionary should be almost entirely nouns, but isn't yet carefully curated to be good for drawing.

The list of selected words is greyed out so you don't give yourself an advantage by seeing them early. Use the copy button to put them straight on your clipboard, then paste into the custom box on Skribbl.
