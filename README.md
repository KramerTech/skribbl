# Random custom [word list generator](https://kramertech.github.io/skribbl) for [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/)

If the default skribbl.io list is getting a bit repetitive for you and your friends, visit [https://kramertech.github.io/skribbl](https://kramertech.github.io/skribbl) to get a randomized list of properly formatted (comma-separated) words to mix things up.

There are over 6000 words in the dictionary, and 300 (by default) will be selected at random each time the page loads. Adjust the `?len=` query param in the URL for more or less random words. The dictionary should be almost entirely nouns, but isn't yet carefully curated to be specifically good for drawing.

The list of selected words is greyed out so you don't give yourself an advantage by seeing them early. Use the copy button to put them straight on your clipboard, then paste into the custom box on Skribbl's private room screen. I'd also recommend checking `Use custom words exclusively.`
