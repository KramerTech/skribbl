There are over 6000 words in the dictionary, and 300 (by default) will be selected at random each time the page loads.

Adjust the `?len=` query param in the URL for more or less random words.

The dictionary should be almost entirely nouns, but isn't carefully curated to be good for drawing.

Selected random words are greyed out on the page so you don't give yourself an advantage by seeing them early. Use the copy button to put them straight on your clipboard.
